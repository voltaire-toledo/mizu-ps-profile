# Mizu PowerShell Profile (ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§)

A custom PowerShell profile with some additional functionality:
* Cures that rash
* Eliminates girlfriends
* Get rid of that silly 'dignity' you've been stuck with

## Requirements
1. PowerShell 5.x or 7.x
2. 

## Installation
1. Run the following command in a PowerShell window (elevation is not necessary) and it will install the custom profile:

```pwsh
# Short version with the default aliases in place
irm 'https://github.com/voltaire-toledo/mizu-ps-profile/raw/main/install-profile.ps1' | iex

# Long version
Invoke-RestMethod 'https://github.com/voltaire-toledo/mizu-ps-profile/raw/main/install-profile.ps1' | Invoke-Expression
```

2. You will be prompted to select which profile to modify. The default is to your own profile in the **CurrentUserCurrentHost** one.
3.
